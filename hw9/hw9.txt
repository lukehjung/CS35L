4/5. Change log
emacs 
C-x 4 a

I copy pasted the commit description into the emacs ChangeLog, but only
the the ones where the file was changed correctly.

6. Commit Changes
man git commit
git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. Generate formatted patch file
man git format-patch
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. Applying partner's 
First need to make a new checkout branch called partner
git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

My partner's name:
Dominic Loftus
203-910-863

Then used the command
git am formatted-patch-dom.txt

Once it's patched, we go through the process of building the new file

./bootstrap
patch -p0 <diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make

make check

And we see that things are successful.

9. Make Distdir
make distdir
cd diffutils-3.0.1-41d4
emacs ChangeLog

Looking into this file, I see Dominic's comments in the changelog so it
works 

10. Gitk
To load a 3rd party application, I had to first download xquartz on my
computer and restart it.  I went to their main website 
https://www.xquartz.org/ and installed it.  I then tried to gitk the
path for eggert's library, but it really wasn't opening so I decided to
just download the git from the website and run the command in there.
I actually got a few errors when installing but it seemed to work.

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
gitk

Doing this opened up xquartz window and I could see all the different
commits and changes.
