Lab 3

1. Grab Coreutils sig  and GNU keyring
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Didn't get any problems but it said that my key is not certified or
that the signature belongs to it's owner.

2. Download and install coreutils
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
tar xf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
mkdir coreutilsInstall
cd coreutils-8.29
./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/luke/cs35l/lab/lab3/coreutilsInstall
make
make install

3. Reproduce bug
mkdir test
touch .
touch ..
touch .foo
touch foo

ls -aA shows all 4 files, not just the 2

4. Patch the bug
cd coreutils-8.29
emacs patchfile.diff
-paste patch into this file

patch -p1 <patchfile.diff

5. make
This command remakes files that have ls in it and dir files
because these are the files that the patch fixed.

Q1. The patch slightly decreases performance because it has to check 
for multiple options when parsing through the options for the ls command.

Q2. I would probably watch out for making sure 
the new ls command works as intended and as 
quickly as before the patch.  Other applications 
shouldn't be affected becausewe didn't change 
anything to their code.
