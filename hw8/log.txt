First thing we did was follow the piazza post about setting up the
beaglebone, installing drivers and connecting it to wifi

1. Connect to beaglebone and wifi

a. connect to beaglebone through usb.
ssh root@192.168.7.2 

b. Set up wifi
connmanctl
enable wifi
scan wifi
services
agent on
connect wifi_2cf7f1068fec_4352333736302d77696669_managed_psk
quit

2. Update database of apt-get and download openssh
a. grab updates for database and apt-get function
apt-get update
apt-get install xauth
apt-get install xvfb

b. install software to for open-ssh, client and server
apt-get install openssh-server
apt-get install openssh-client

3. Generate public and private keys
ssh-keygen
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
0a:9d:cc:5e:5d:2f:45:86:7d:b7:b4:3f:b9:e3:5b:c1 root@304805526.lasr.cs.ucla.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|             oo  |
|            .o..o|
|            . o.+|
|     + . . . o.o |
|    . = S . . .Eo|
|     o o     . oo|
|      o         +|
|               o.|
|              .oo|
+-----------------+

4. Set up user on the server
a. Sets up my user on the beaglebone to be able to log into
useradd -d /home/luke -m luke
passwd luke

b. Give the beaglebone user accessibility from outside
cd /home/luke
mkdir .ssh
chown -R luke .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh

5. Log into partner's beaglebone
a. Log into specified ip address using ifconfig
ifconfig
ssh-copy-id -i luke@10.97.85.49

b. Save a private key to the user so don't need a passphrase everytime.
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add
ssh luke@10.97.85.49

Now when we log into each other's beaglebone's, we don't have to put
in a passphrase.

Also, we are able to run commands like xterm on the different beaglebones,
as long as we login with the -X command when we ssh.

Therefore, we ahve successfully logged into each other's beaglebones,
both being able to be the client and the serve on both accounts.
