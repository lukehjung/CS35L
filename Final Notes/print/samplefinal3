1. 
a. Yes, a string can be anything because the * on the side says it can exist and not
b. No, a string like a would appear in a|ba but not in (a|b)a
c. Yes, a string like a would appear in both and would only have occurences of aa

2. The path variable is an environment variable that explicitly says where the path
of the functions will be going when calling a program.  For example, when setting the PATH
to usr/local/cs/bin, we're able to access the newest gcc 

3. A possible reason for the error is that we don't have the correct permissions so we need
to use chmod +x buildwords.sh to gain execute permissions to run the command.

4. 
default: srot.o
gcc srot.o -o srot

srot.o: srot.c
gcc -o2 srot.c -o srot.o

clean:
rm -rf *.o 

5. 
gccversion=0
gccversion=`gcc --version | sed -n '1p' | sed  's/gcc//' | sed 's/\((GCC)\|\s\)//g'`
if [ $gccversion != '4.7.2' ]; then
        echo "This software requires gcc 4.7.2"
fi

6. System calls are calls to the kernel which are able to do more tasks through the CPU
We use them judiciously because they take a lot of overhead.

7. The putchar implementation uses the write feature only 1 byte at a time which is a lot of
cost for not doing too much work.  We'll be doing the system call a whole bunch of times which
will create a bottleneck, especially when working with larger files.

8. 
	int AXIS_X = 100, AXIS_Y = 200, AXIS_Z = 300;
	float ***M;
	int i,j,k;
	// Allocating three dimensional dynamic array
	M=(float ***) malloc(AXIS_X * sizeof(float ***));
	
	for(i=0;  i<AXIS_X;  i++)
	{
		M[i]=(float **)malloc(AXIS_Y * sizeof(float *));
		
		for(j=0;  j<AXIS_Y;  j++)
		{
			M[i][j]=(float *)malloc(AXIS_Z * sizeof(float));
		}
	}

	free(M);

9. I would first need to add her as a user on the server using
useradd -d /home/alice -m alice
passwd alice

Then I would have to change the accessibility options for the user
cd /home/alice
mkdir .ssh
chown -R alice.ssh
chmod 700 .ssh

And then I'd tell her to logon to the server using her name and the passwd
alice, and then her public key would be saved to the .ssh file.

She'd run applications on the server using ssh -X, which uses X11 port forwarding
so she can run GUI applications on the server.

10. Alice would want to encrypt the message using Bob's public key so that when it's 
sent, Bob could decrypt it using his private key.  This works because the public key is
something that everyone can use to first decrypt, but only Bob's private key can decode
the message.

11. cat make-log.txt | sed -n '2p' | sed 's/real [0-9].//g' | sed 's/\..*//'

12. This program makes it vulnerable to stack smashing exploits, since it's reading the stdin
and replaces the new line character with \0.  This allows for malicious code to be placed on 
the stack array which can run functions that will change files.

14. Program exceptions are events taht dirsupt the normal execution of the program.  
To handle exceptions in python, we use try and except blocks
>>> while True:
...     try:
...         x = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
...         break
...     except ValueError:
...         print("Oops!  That was no valid number.  Try again...")

16. Version control system helps to consolidate code

17. distributed control system lets each person work and branch off of code
also it helps to access changesets much faster bc lcocally. Can push changesets
all at once.  

18.
a. use git log or git status to see commits
b. you'd have to git add, git commit, and git push
c. use git log and check to see where it happened
