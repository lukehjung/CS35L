2. /usr/bin/mv /usr/bin/sh
Using the which command will show the path of each program.

Using readline /usr/bin/emacs, we find the actual file where the emacs program is located
5. usr/bin/gcc version: gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-28)
Plain gcc: gcc (GCC) 8.2.0
They are different versions because the first one is a specified program in the usr/bin, while the plain gcc grabs the file from /usr/local/cs/bin
6. u+sx means giving the user who owns the file permissions of set user or group ID on execution and ability to execute.

You can easily invoke it when you kill a selection with C-w, you can use C-y to put it back, or reinserting.
